## Introduction:
This repository contains the AI backend for the DayPilot project, focused on processing speech-to-text inputs into structured task data. Built with Flask, this API serves as the connection between the Android mobile app (built in Android Studio) and the task generation logic.

When a user taps the microphone button in the Android app, the device captures voice input using Android‚Äôs built-in speech-to-text feature. That converted text is then sent to this AI model via a POST request. Upon receiving the text, the model interprets the user's intent and returns a structured response that the app uses to create a new task.

This AI system acts as the ears of the app turning casual voice input into actionable task data for a smarter, faster task-creation experience.

## Feactures:

- Converts voice input from Android into structured task data
- Receives speech-to-text text via API
- Analyzes user intent using AI model
- Returns parsed task components (title, time, date, etc)
- ### How It Works

  1. üì± Android app captures user speech and converts it to text.
  2. üåê The Android app sends the text to the AI backend endpoint using an HTTP request.
  3. üß† AI model analyzes the text and identifies task-related information (e.g. title, date, time).
  4. üîÅ The response is sent back to the Android app to generate the task.

## Technologies:
- **Python 3.12.8** ‚Äì Core programming language used for AI logic and API
- **Tensor Flow** ‚Äì Deep learning model integration
- **JSON** ‚Äì Data format for request/response between app and server
  
  <h3 align="center">API</h3>

**Flask** ‚Äì Lightweight Python framework for building RESTful APIs
-  Flask receives incoming POST requests from the Android app.
- It parses the JSON data that contains the user's spoken input (converted to text by android built-in MicrophoneX).
- The text is passed to the AI model for intent parsing and task extraction.
- Flask then sends the model‚Äôs response back to the app in structured JSON format.
 
All of this logic is contained in the Flask app within this repository.
